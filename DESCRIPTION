Description: Reporting heritability estimates is an important to quantitative genetics 
  studies and breeding experiments. Here we provide functions to calculate various broad-sense
  heritabilities from 'asreml' and 'lme4' model objects. All methods we have implemented 
  in this package have extensively discussed in the article by Schmidt et al. (2019) <doi:10.1534/genetics.119.302134>.
