Description: Reporting heritability estimates is an important part of quantitative genetics in breeding experiments.
 This package provides functions to calculate various heritability summary statistics, including narrow-sense heritability, broad-sense heritability, and other related metrics
 from asreml and soon to be lme4 model objects.
