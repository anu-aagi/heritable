\title{Calculate Oakey's heritability}
\usage{
h2_Oakey(model, target, method, options)
H2_Oakey(model, target, method, options)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model object of class \code{lmerMod/merMod} or \code{asreml}}

\item{target}{The name of the random effect for which heritability is to be calculated.}

\item{options}{NULL by default, for internal checking of model object before calculations}
}
\description{
Compute heritability for genotype means using the variance–covariance matrix of the genotype BLUPs
as described by Oakey et al. (2006).
}
\details{
\deqn{H^2_{Oakey} = \frac{\sum_{i = n_z+1}^{n_g} \lambda_i}{\sum_{n_g}^{\lambda_i\neq 0}}}
where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{n_g} is the number of genotypes
\item \eqn{n_z} is the number of zero eigenvalues
\item \eqn{\lambda_i} is the ith eigenvalue of the matrix \eqn{I_{m} - G^{-1}C^{gg}}
\item \eqn{\sigma^2} is the variance attributed to differences between genotype
}
