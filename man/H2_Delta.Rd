\title{Calculate average heritability of differences between genotypes from model object}
\usage{
H2_Delta(model,
         target,
         type = c("BLUP", "BLUE"),
         aggregate = c("arithmetic", "harmonic"),
         options
         )
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{character, whether heritability is calculated using BLUEs or BLUPs}

\item{aggregate}{character, when taking means in the calculation, should harmonic or arithmetic mean be used?}

\item{options}{NULL by default, for internal checking of model object before calculations}
}
\value{
Numeric
}
\description{
Instead of computing heritability on a "entry-mean" basis, this method
calculates heritability using "entry-differences". Entry here is
referring to the genotype, line or variety of interest. See
reference for origin and interpretation of \code{H2_Delta} and it's variants
}
\details{
The heritability of differences between genotypes is given by:

\deqn{H^2_{\Delta ..} = 1 - \frac{PEV^{BLUP}_{\overline\Delta ..}}{2\sigma^2_g}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{PEV^{BLUP}_{\overline\Delta ..}} is the mean of the prediction error variance matrix for the pairwise differences among BLUPs (BLUEs if \code{method = "BLUE"}) across all genotypes
\item \eqn{\sigma^2} is the variance attributed to differences between genotype
}

See reference page 995 - 997 for full derivation of this heritability measure and related variants
