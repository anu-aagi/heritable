\title{Calculate heritability of differences for a given genotype}
\usage{
h2_Delta_by_genotype(model, target, type = c("BLUE", "BLUP"), options)
H2_Delta_by_genotype(model, target, type = c("BLUE", "BLUP"), options)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model object of class \code{lmerMod/merMod} or \code{asreml}}

\item{target}{The name of the random effect for which heritability is to be calculated.}

\item{type}{character, whether heritability is calculated using BLUEs or BLUPs}

\item{options}{NULL by default, for internal checking of model object before calculations}
}
\value{
Numeric

Named list, with each element containing a named numeric vector
}
\description{
Instead of computing heritability on a "entry-mean" basis, this method
calculates heritability using "entry-differences". Entry here is
referring to the genotype, line or variety of interest. See
reference for origin and interpretation of \code{h2/H2_Delta_by_genotype} and it's variants
}
\details{
The heritability of differences for a given genotype is given by:

\deqn{H^2_{\Delta i.} = 1 - \frac{PEV^{BLUP}_{\overline\Delta i.}}{2\sigma^2_g}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{PEV^{BLUP}_{\overline\Delta i.}} is the arithmetic mean of the prediction error variance matrix for pairwise differences among BLUPs (or BLUEs if \code{method = "BLUE"}) for a given genotype
\item \eqn{\sigma^2} is the variance attributed to differences between genotype
}

See reference page 995 - 997 for full derivation of this heritability measure and related variants
