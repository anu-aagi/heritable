\title{Fixed-effects-only fitted values from an asreml model}
\usage{
get_fixed_fit_asreml(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{"asreml"}, fitted with
\code{model.frame = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \eqn{N}, giving the fixed-effects-only
fitted value for each observation.
}
\description{
Returns the fitted values based on fixed effects only
(\eqn{\hat{y} = X\hat{\beta}}), excluding all random effects.
}
\details{
This function reconstructs the fixed-effect design matrix from the
stored model frame and multiplies it by the estimated fixed
coefficients. Sparse fixed terms (if any) are included.

Random effects (BLUPs) are not included.
