\title{Calculate average heritability of differences between genotypes}
\usage{
h2_Delta(model, target, type = c("BLUP", "BLUE"), aggregate = c("arithmetic", "harmonic"), options)
H2_Delta(model, target, type = c("BLUP", "BLUE"), aggregate = c("arithmetic", "harmonic"), options)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model object of class \code{lmerMod/merMod} or \code{asreml}}

\item{target}{The name of the random effect for which heritability is to be calculated.}

\item{type}{character, whether heritability is calculated using BLUEs or BLUPs}

\item{aggregate}{character, when taking means in the calculation, should harmonic or arithmetic mean be used?}

\item{options}{NULL by default, for internal checking of model object before calculations}

\description{
Calculate average heritability of differences between genotypes
}
\details{
The heritability of differences between genotypes is given by:

\deqn{H^2_{\Delta ..} = 1 - \frac{PEV^{BLUP}_{\overline\Delta ..}}{2\sigma^2_g}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{PEV} is the prediction error variance matrix of the pairwise differences among BLUPs (BLUEs if \code{method = "BLUE"})
\item \eqn{\sigma^2} is the variance attributed to differences between genotype
}

See reference page 995 - 997 for full derivation of this heritability measure and related variants
